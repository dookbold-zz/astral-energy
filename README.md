A magitech mod! Use the power of the stars to power your machines!

Stars on their own produce little Astral Energy, however the universe is full of stars! The stars are each 
manipulating bits of Astral Energy because of their gravity, that warps, magnifies, or refracts the energy 
into multiple directions. The proximity of the Sun interferes with this energy so Astral Energy is less 
effective in the day, the energy reduces to 5% of its optimal power at high noon.

Long ago, there lived a race from beyond the stars, they brought their knowledge and technology to this 
world to spread their message of the stars. The race has long since vanished, an unknown cataclysm which 
came upon the world like a vengeful tide. All that remains are ruins, and guardians, to protect from an 
unknown evil long since gone. Now their only purpose is to guard the sanctums of their elders.
