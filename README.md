A magitech mod! Use the power of the stars to power your machines!

Stars on their own produce little Astral Energy, however the universe is full of stars! The stars are each manipulating bits of Astral Energy because of their gravity, that warps, magnifies, or refracts the energy into multiple directions. The proximity of the Sun interferes with this energy so Astral Energy is less effective in the day, the energy reduces to 5% of its optimal power at high noon.
